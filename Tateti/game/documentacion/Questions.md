### How i can return a matrix from a function?

Due like i want to separate logic from view, and i have to calculate in which place 
the placer can add his mark, i need to save that data into a matrix
and then return it to the view

The problem here is that, it is not easy, cause someone cannot return 
in easy a matrix, but there are a few ways to make it:

- Using dynamic array
- Using static keyword
- Using Struct technique

In this case i will use static keyword cause i belive this is the more easy way
